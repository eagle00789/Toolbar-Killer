<p>As shown in the image above, it is obvious that the options screen has been devided into several sections. Below is an explenation of each section.</p>
<h4>Section: <b>Message Options</b></h4>
<p>In this section, you have the option to disable some messages. These messages are:</p>
<ul><li>Show warning before removing toolbars</li><li>Show warning before closing browsers.</li></ul>
<p>The first options displays a message when you click on remove, to ask you if you are sure. The second options displays a message to ask you if the program can close the open browser windows (firefox and internet explorer)</p>
<h4>Section: <b>Log Options</b></h4>
<p>The Log Options are to create a logfile. By default, the creation of the logfile is enabled, but the Detailed Log File is disabled, as is the deletion of the old logfile at the start of the program. A logfile could come in handy when diagnosing a problem related to TbU, so if you run into troubles, please enable the logifle and the detailed logfile and work upto the point where you get stuck. Then follow the on-screen instructions</p>
<h4>Section: <b>Lists</b></h4>
<p>There are 3 lists available:</p>
<ul><li><a href="white-list.htm">White-list</a></li><li><a href="black-list.htm">Black-list</a></li><li><a href="Toolbars-list.htm">All toolbars</a></li></ul>
<p>The white list is a list where you can authorize toolbars so that they will not show up on the detected toolbars list. This prevents accidental deleteion of toolbars that must stay.<br>
The blacklist is only a list where you can see wich toolbars are automaticly marked for deletion. These toolbars present a high security risk.<br>
The All Toolbars list is just a list where you can see wich toolbars can be detected</p>
<h4>Section: <b>Updates</b></h4>
<p>If you check the box "Check for updates on program start", then at each start of the program, the program checks if there is a new version available of the detection file or the program itself and downloads it.</p>
<h4>Section: <b>Langugae</b></h4>
<p>In the language section, you can select a language to translate the entire program into your native language.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p><p>The <a href="Update.htm">Update</a> button is the button to check if there are updates available for the program or the detectionfile and downloads it.</p>
